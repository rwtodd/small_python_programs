# Five Nights Game

I played a board game recently called **Five Nights at Freddy's**, and I wanted to recreate the solitaire version
of it in python.  To do this, I experimented with writing a spec, and letting Gemini Pro v2.5 draft the code. 
I think the results were very impressive (circa March 2025).

The design document is in the repo, and explains the rules.
