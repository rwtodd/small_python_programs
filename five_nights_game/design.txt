We are going to model a solitaire board game.  In this game, there are 6 types of cards:
   - "Animatronic" (4 of them)
   - "Empty Room" (8 of them)
   - "Power Drain" (9 of them)
   - "What Was That?" Down Arrow (9 of them)
   - "What Was That?" Right Arrow (9 of them)
   - "What Was That?" Double Right Arrow (9 of them)

There are a total of 48 cards.  At the start of the game, you take out the Animatronic cards and shuffle the
rest of them.  These are divided into 4 piles like this:

  - Pile 1: 10 cards + 2 animatronic cards (shuffled into the pile)
  - Pile 2: 11 cards + 1 animatronic card (shuffled into the pile)
  - Pile 3: 11 cards + 1 animatronic card (shuffled into the pile)
  - Pile 4: 12 cards

There are 12 rounds, labeled as half-hours from midnight to 5:30am (so:  12:00, 12:30, 1:00, 1:30, etc).

The player has a power meter that starts at 100%.

There is a 6-sided die called a "power die", with 2 blank sides, 2 sides labelled 5, and 2 sides labelled 10

In each round, the following occurs:

Step 0: Update the state of the game.  If this is not the first round, the time advances (e.g., from 12:00 to 12:30, and so on.)
Also, if any of the piles have become empty, the cards from the next-lowest-numbered pile are moved into the empty slots.  So, the
highest-numbered piles will always have cards if any are left.

Step 1: Draw a card from every pile that still has cards.  Special case: if the card drawn is animatronic, draw additional cards from that
pile until either the last card drawn is _not_ animatronic, or you run out of cards in the pile.  Keep track of which pile all drawn cards
are from, as it will matter in the following ssteps.

Step 2: If the player's power level is 0% or below, skip to Step 4.  Otherwise: ask the player to pick from 0 to 2 of the 
drawn cards he wants to "react to".  Here are the result of "reacting to" a card:
   - "Animatronic": the card is shuffled back into the pile it came from 
   - "What Was That?" Down Arrow: the card is discarded 
   - "What Was That?" Right Arrow: the card is discarded
   - "What Was That?" Double Right Arrow: the card is discarded
The following cards cannot be reacted to:
   - "Empty Room"
   - "Power Drain"

Step 3: Assess a power cost of the reactions from step 2.  For each reaction, roll the "power die" and deduct the amount from 
the players power meter.  Also, for every "Power Drain" card that was drawn, subtract another 5 from the player's power meter. 
Note: if the player does not react to any cards this round, then power drain cards do not have an effect.

Step 4: Resolve any remaining drawn cards:
    - "Animatronic": place the "Animatronic" card into a random position in the next pile (for example, if it was drawn from pile 1, it moves to a random spot in pile 2).  If it was already in pile 4, then the player loses the game!
    - "What Was That?" Down Arrow: Another card is drawn from the same pile (assuming there is a card left in the pile to draw), and cannot be reacted to.  It is immediately resolved per these rules in Step 4 (this step). Then, this card is discarded.
    - "What Was That?" Right Arrow: A card is moved from the same pile, and moved over to the next pile (e.g., from pile 1 to pile 2). The moved card is not shown to the player. Then this card is discarded.  Special case: if the card is moved past Pile 4, it is shown to the player and discarded.  If the card was an Animatronic card, the player loses!
    - "What Was That?" Double Right Arrow: A card is moved from the same pile, and moved over two piles (e.g., from pile 1 to pile 3). The moved card is not shown to the player. Then this card is discarded. Special case: if the card is moved past Pile 4, it is shown to the player and discarded.  If the card was an Animatronic card, the player loses!
   - "Empty Room": No effect, it is discarded
   - "Power Drain": No effect, it is discarded.

Step 5: Ways to Lose or Win
 - Ways to Lose: If an Animatronic card is moved past pile 4 (see the ways this can happen in Step 4)
 - Ways to Win: You reach the end of 5:30 round without Losing.
